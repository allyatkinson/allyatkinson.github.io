	<div class="ingredients">	
		<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> 1 lb. Ground Turkey </li>
			<li> 2.5 tbs. Cumin </li>
			<li> 2 tbs. Chili Powder </li>
			<li> 2 tsp. Minced Garlic (I like the pre-minced from a jar) </li>
			<li> 1 tbs. Cilantro </li>
			<li> 1 tbs. Parsley </li>
			<li> Salt </li>
			<li> Pepper </li>
		</ul>

	<h3> Instructions: </h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Spray Pam cooking spray into a medium sized frying pan </li>
		<li> Turn heat on medium-high and let the pan heat up </li>
		<li> While you're waiting for the pan to heat up, prepare your ingredients as stated in the following steps </li>
		<li> Put ground turkey in a mixing bowl </li>	
		<li> Add all of your herbs and spices into the bowl with the ground turkey </li>
		<li> Using your hands, mix up all of the ingredients into the turkey so everthing is combined evenly </li>
		<li> Take a small handful of the turkey mixture and roll it into a ball slightly larger than a golf ball </li>
		<li> Take your ball and press down to flatten it into a patty and make an indent in the middle of the patty to help your burger cook through evenly </li>
		<li> Repeat steps 7 and 8 until you've used up all of your ground turkey (this should make about 5-6 burgers) </li>
		<li> Place your raw patties onto the hot frying pan </li>
		<li> Cook one side for approximately 6 minutes, checking periodically to make sure it is not burning </li>
		<li> Flip burger and cook for 4-5 minutes (if you want to add a slice of cheese on top, this would be the time to do so) </li>
		<li> Cut open one of the burgers to make sure they are cooked through </li>
		<li> Put burger on a bun and  add any desired toppings </li>
		<li> Enjoy! </li>
	</ol>
	<p> There you have it! These turkey burgers are super easy and yummy. To keep the healthy choices going, try sweet potato fries as a side! They are still yummy like regular french fries but are a little healthier! If you do not want to take on making them yourself, you can buy frozen ones. My favorite are the All Natural Alexia Seasoned Sweet Potato Waffle Fries. You can find them at any grocery store in the frozen foods aisle and they are easy to make, just follow the instructions on the bag!</p>
