	<h4> Oven Roasted Vegetables </h4>

	<p> Looking for a simple and delicious side dish that goes with any meal? Look no further than my yummy oven roasted vegetables. Note: I am not putting measurements for this dish. Make as much or as little as you need!

	<div class="recipe">

	<div class="ingredients">	
		<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Baby carrots, whole </li>
			<li> Celery, roughly chopped </li>
			<li> Baby red potatoes, cut into small wedges </li>
			<li> baby portobello mushrooms, cut into quarter sized pieces </li>
			<li> White onion</li>
			<li> Fresh Parsley (they sell little containers of pre-chopped herbs at the grocery store that keep for while in the fridge) </li>
			<li> Olive oil </li>
			<li> Celery seed</li>
			<li> Coarse sea salt</li>
			<li> Red pepper flakes</li>
			<li> Oregano</li>
			<li> Rosemary</li>
			<li> Thyme</li>
			<li> Pepper</li>
		</ul>

	<h3> Instructions: </h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees</li>
		<li> Place desired chopped vegetables on a baking sheet (with raised edges) </li>
		<li> Drizzle olive oil over vegetables (you don't want too much excess oil so just enough to coat the veggies without it pooling onto the pan)</li>
		<li> Sprinkle spices and herbs onto vegetables, if you like a lot of flavor, sprinkle generously, if you like light flavor, spinkle less..be careful with the celery seed, garlic, and thyme, the flavors can be quite powerful, less is more</li>
		<li> With you hands, toss the vegetables around on the pan so they are evenly coated with the olive oil and your herbs and spices</li>
		<li> Place baking sheet in the oven</li>
		<li> Cook for 20-35 minutes depending on how many veggies you chose to make (smaller amout=less time, larger amount=more time).</li>
	</ol>
	<p> These oven roasted vegetables are insanely healthy and go great with anything! Serve them with frozen shrimp that you heated in butter in a frying pan or with chicken over a bed of fresh spinach for a filling salad. This recipe can be mixed and matched with just about anything and you can add or take away different vegetables or seasonings to change it up. If you make a large amount, you could have enough for a few days of meals and then you'd only have to add protein!</p>

	<p> Below I have included a link on wines that pair well with roasted vegetables</p>
