	<h4> Tradtional Pot Roast </h4>

	<p> Don't let those cold winter days get you feeling down and lazy! Here's a recipe for pot roast that you can cook while you're at work or sleeping. Confession: my biggest fear is my apartment catching on fire while my dog is home alone... I never leave my crock pot on when I'm not home, even though that's what they're made for, so I cook in my crockpot over-night just in case.

	<p> Pot roast has always been a winter staple in my home. It's warm and comforting for those cold winter nights. This recipe is super easy, you really just toss your ingredients in your crock pot, put it on low, and cook it for 6-8 hours. You can  forget about it until your timer goes off and then boom, your dinner is ready. The best part about it is it makes so much food that you'll have enough to get 3-4 meals out of it! If you don't have a crockpot, I highly recommend getting one. I have the Bella 5 quart programmable one. Its great because it has a built-in timer on it and when the timer runs out, it automatically switches to the "keep warm" setting. This is great for me because I cook in my crock pot while I sleep so I do not have to worry about getting up at the right time to turn off the crockpot, it does it for me! Below I have added a link to this crockpot.</p>
