	<div class="ingredients">	
		<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> 12 fresh scallops </li>
			<li> 3 tbs salted butter </li>
			<li> 1 lemon wedge </li>
			<li> 1/2 tbs garlic (I buy the pre-minced jars, it’s way easier) </li>
			<li> Fresh Parsley (they sell little containers of pre-chopped herbs at the grocery store that keep for while in the fridge) </li>
			<li> Optional: Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay </li>
		</ul>

	<h3> Instructions: </h3>
	<ol>
		<li> Melt butter in a frying pan, keep the heat on medium-high </li>
		<li> While melting the butter, add garlic to the pan </li>
		<li> Once the butter is melted and piping hot, add the scallops to the hot pan and keep the heat on, this will allow the butter to make a nice crust on the scallops. The scallops should sizzle in the pan, if they don’t, turn up the heat! </li>
		<li> Sprinkle parsley on the scallops once you add them to the pan </li>	
		<li>  Cook the scallops on each side until a nice brown crust forms on both sides </li>
		<li>  Remove your scallops from heat, squeeze the lemon wedge over the scallops and serve!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Note: you shouldn’t have to cook the scallops for more than 5 mins on each side </p>
	<p> This recipe for scallops is quick, easy, and decadent. Make sure to take a few shots of your meal for instagram and your friends will think you’re a master chef, when really it only took 10 mins and was so simple. To add more flavor, add 1/3 cup of Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay to the melted butter and garlic mixture before adding the scallops to the hot pan. I take any excuse to add wine to my dishes because once the bottle is open, you’ve got to drink up! I generally like to pair my scallops with white rice or jasmine rice and either sautéed green beans or asparagus. Also, I usually buy 12 scallops because that is enough to have dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day, because this meal is so good you can’t eat it just once! Enjoy!</p>

	<p> below I have included a link for a list of wines that pair well with scallops</p>
